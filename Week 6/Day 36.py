print("\nChallenge: Lexicographically Smallest Palindrome")
print("Context: You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, and you are allowed to perform operations on it. In one operation, you can replace a character in s with another lowercase English letter.\n- Your task is to make s a palindrome with the minimum number of operations possible. If there are multiple palindromes that can be made using the minimum number of operations, make the lexicographically smallest one.\n- A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.\n- Return the resulting palindrome string.")

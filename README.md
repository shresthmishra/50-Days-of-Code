Welcome to my 50 Days of Code journey! Inspired by Shri Ram sir, I'm participating in the #DrGViswanathanChallenge as part of my coding journey at VIT Bhopal. 
Over the next 50 days, I'll be solving coding problems, improving my skills, and documenting my progress here.

I appreciate you mummy and papa, for everything. 

Goals
- Solve at least one coding problem per day for 50 days.
- Enhance my problem-solving skills in Python.
- Document solutions, thought processes, and lessons learned.
- Build a strong portfolio of coding projects.

Acknowledgments
- Inspired by Shri Ram sir for his guidance and motivation.
- Part of the #DrGViswanathanChallenge at VIT Bhopal.
- Thanks to LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks for providing amazing problem sets.

Making my parents proud would be an amazing feat for me, and for which I'm happy to work as hard as I can.

Thank you.
